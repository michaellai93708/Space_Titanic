# Space_Titanic
This project was part of a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview). It is a frictional project whose primary goal is to predict whether a given individual was transported into a higher dimension. For a detailed introduction of the dataset, please refer to the Kaggle -> Spaceship Titanic page (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data). 
The highest accuracy achieved was 79% with LightGBM, which was 4% lower than the SOTA algorithms in terms of accuracy. In the pre-processing stage, ID, Cabin and Name were split. Since part of the ID indicating the travelling group and cabin include information regarding the traveller's set arrangement. The name feature was split into first and last names, where the last name might be helpful since passengers who share the same last tend to sit next to each other. Categorical variables were then encoded using the label encoding technique, which converted all categorical features into numerical (integer) representation. All Null values were also replaced by the corresponding feature mean. In the training process, a grid search was performed, and eventually learning rate was set to 0.1, num_leaves was set to 20, feature fraction was set to 0.9, max depth was set to 15, max bin was set to 100 and min data in leaf was set to 2.
